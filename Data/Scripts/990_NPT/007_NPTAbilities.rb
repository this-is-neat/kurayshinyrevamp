# 007_NPTAbilities.rb
# Battle effect handlers for NPT-registered abilities (those added in 005_Abilities.rb).
# Follows the same BattleHandlers pattern as 011_Battle/003_BattleHandlers_Abilities.rb
# and 659_Multiplayer/008_Family/010_BoostedTalents.rb.
#
# Type Infusion compatibility (011_TypeInfusion.rb):
#   Type-converting abilities (Aerilate, Galvanize, etc.) are automatically compatible.
#   pbCalcType returns the post-conversion type, so STAB checks fire correctly and
#   Family type infusion triggers on converted STAB moves without any special handling.
#
# NOTE: Some abilities here already have handlers in the base engine
#   (011_Battle/003_BattleHandlers_Abilities.rb). Declaring them here is safe —
#   BattleHandlers.add stores by symbol key, so this overwrites with identical logic.
#   The 005_Abilities.rb stub registration is what makes these handlers actually fire.

#===============================================================================
# AERILATE
# Normal-type moves become Flying-type. Power boosted by 1.2x.
#
# Base engine already implements this in 003_BattleHandlers_Abilities.rb.
# Declared here explicitly so 007 is self-contained and documents all NPT abilities.
#
# Type Infusion: Aerilate-converted moves are Flying-type. If the user has Flying
# type, pbCalcType returns :FLYING → pbHasType? returns true → infusion triggers
# automatically. No extra code needed.
#===============================================================================

#     (a) the throw was from the LOCAL player (pbOwnedByPlayer?(idxBattler))

#   This ensures each client independently handles their own Pokémon's ability
#   without interfering with the ally's ball throws or bag.
#

# CUD CHEW
# When the holder eats a Berry, it will eat that Berry again at the end of the

#   @cudchew_state  — :waiting (consumed this turn) → :ready (replay next EOR)
#
# Step 1: Alias pbHeldItemTriggered to detect own-berry consumption.
#   own_item=true means the battler ate its OWN held item.
#   own_item=false (Bug Bite / Fling / Cud Chew replay) is ignored — prevents
#   infinite re-queuing and correctly excludes stolen berries.

#   (Sitrus, Oran, Figy…) bypass their HP-threshold requirement on replay.

# GORILLA TACTICS
# Boosts the holder's Attack by 1.5× but restricts it to using only the first
# move it selects each time it enters battle (identical to Choice Band locking).
#
# BASE ENGINE DOES NOT HANDLE THIS — full implementation below.
#
# Implementation uses two aliases on PokeBattle_Battler:
#
# 1. DamageCalcUserAbility — 1.5× attack_multiplier for physical moves.
#
# 2. pbEndTurn alias — after each turn, if GORILLATACTICS is active and no
#    lock is stored yet, record @npt_gorilla_move = the move just used.
#    The engine's existing ChoiceBand locking (PBEffects::ChoiceBand) is
#    item-specific and clears itself immediately when no Choice item is held,
#    so we must track the lock in a separate instance variable.
#
# 3. pbCanChooseMove? alias — before a move is selected/used, if
#    @npt_gorilla_move is set and GORILLATACTICS is active, block any move
#    other than the locked one (same message format as Choice Band).
#
# 4. pbInitEffects alias — clears @npt_gorilla_move on every switch-in so
#    the lock resets when the Pokémon leaves and re-enters battle (matching
#    real-game behaviour and preventing slot-reuse pollution).
#
# Edge cases handled:
#   • Ability suppressed mid-battle (Gastro Acid): pbCanChooseMove? checks
#     hasActiveAbility?(:GORILLATACTICS) → false → lock not enforced.
#   • Locked move becomes unavailable (Disable/Encore PP drain): the lock is
#     cleared so the battler can choose freely, same as Choice Band.
#   • Baton Pass: pbInitEffects(batonPass=true) still clears the lock —
#     intentional, the new Pokémon is not constrained.

#
# Implementation:
#   - Alias abilityActive?: directly scans for an active gas holder each call.
#     No flags needed — automatically applies to battlers entering mid-gas and
#     handles multiple gas holders (any remaining holder keeps gas active).
#   - AbilityOnSwitchIn: activation message.

#     remaining battlers AFTER the holder is marked as gone (@fainted=true).
#   - Alias pbFaint: same as above for the faint case + dissipation message.
#
# Co-op: the direct scan covers all battler positions on all sides.

#   including type-modifying ones — infused type logic in DamageCalcUserAbility

# RECEIVER
# When an ally faints, the holder copies the fainted ally's ability.
# Base engine already handles this — AbilityChangeOnBattlerFainting.copy copies
# the POWEROFALCHEMY handler to RECEIVER (003_BattleHandlers_Abilities.rb:2411).
# No additional code needed.

#===============================================================================
# MERCILESS — guaranteed critical hit on poisoned targets
#
# The base engine registers a CriticalCalcUserAbility handler for :MERCILESS
# (003_BattleHandlers_Abilities.rb:1253) that sets c=99, caught by the
# `return true if c>50` check in pbIsCritical?.
#
# BUG: triggerCriticalCalcUserAbility receives `user.ability` which is a
# GameData::Ability object, but the handler hash is keyed by Symbol
# (:MERCILESS). GameData::Ability doesn't override eql?/hash, so Ruby's
# Hash#[] never finds the handler. This affects all CriticalCalcUserAbility
# handlers but is only noticeable for Merciless (guaranteed crit vs.
# probability boost).
#
# Fix: directly alias pbIsCritical? to check for Merciless before the
# normal flow. This bypasses the broken handler lookup entirely.
