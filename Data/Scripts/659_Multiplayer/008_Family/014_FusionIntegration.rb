#===============================================================================
# MODULE: Family/Subfamily System - Fusion Integration
#===============================================================================
# Handles Family and Talent inheritance during Pokemon fusion.
#
# Requirements:
#   1. Only BASE talents available for fusion (not boosted variants)
#   2. Boosted talents shown when Family talent = Pokemon's actual talent
#   3. Family inheritance: if one parent has family, fused Pokemon inherits it
#      If both have different families, show choice UI
#
# Integration Points:
#   - PokemonFusion.rb (line 978): Family inheritance after species change
#   - PokemonFusion.rb (line 1160): Ability selection (filter base talents)
#   - FusionMenu.rb: Add Family choice UI if both parents have different families
